# Axis

Axis is a modern C++ game framework/library. The framework is designed to be highly modular and leverages the modern C++ features for safe and fast codes.

## Structure

Axis framework is sub-divided into many different modules for better project organization. Each of the modules is responsible for each specific task.

- **System:** This module provides our custom template container classes, math vectors, math matrices, and abstraction over low-level operating system function calls.
- **Window:** This module provides functionalities to display windows to the screen, process user events, and receive user inputs (mouse, keyboard, touch).
- **Graphics:** This module provides low-level abstractions over various next-gens Graphics APIs.
- **Renderer**: This module provides higher-level graphics functionalities such as: `SpriteBatch` class for fast and optimized 2D rendering
- **Core**: This module provides high-level application functionalities and classes to create a game.

## All of the features are not fully implemented yet
